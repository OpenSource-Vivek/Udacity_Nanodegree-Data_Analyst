# Project - What Drives an Area's Single Percentage?

[TownCharts](http://www.towncharts.com/) provides population data for U.S. cities, towns, and areas. We'll use this data to explore various features in counties across the U.S.


## Project Overview

As a nerd, dating data is fascinating! In this project, we'll explore what features of an area affect single ratios, and what that means for dating. Specifically we'll look at two hypotheses in the dating community.

### Hypothesis 1

There is a widespread theory that the gender ratio of an area affects the single percentage of that gender. This, from a theory standpoint, makes complete sense as human coupling (usually) is 1 to 1. Therefore if there is a gender imbalance of 54 guys for every 46 girls, there will be at least 8 guys single. In this exploration we'll actually dig into the data and see how the ratio of women to men affect the single percentage of that specific gender.

### Hypothesis 2

Another widespread theory is that age affects the single percentage. For example, in areas with younger population, i.e. college towns, there's a much higher percentage of single people. Proposed reasons include: such as people are less serious about marriage; less serious about creating families; and for those in college, life is potentially more of a transitory time with people enrolling and graduating. We'll be exploring this hypothesis, specifically how the single percentage changes with age for different genders.
