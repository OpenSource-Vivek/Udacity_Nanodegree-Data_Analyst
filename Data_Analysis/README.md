# Data Analysis

Python projects for data analysis. Projects go through the entire data analysis process, which includes:
* Posing a question
* Wrangling data into a format that can be used
* Exploring the data, finding patterns in the data, and building intuition about the data
* Drawing conclusions and/or making predictions
* Communicating findings

Also includes Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.
