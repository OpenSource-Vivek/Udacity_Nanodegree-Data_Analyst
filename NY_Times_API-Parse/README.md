# Project - NY Times API

The [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) is a source of news and information. But now it's a source of data, too. [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/), as well as other publishers, provide API's to their site to allow developers to extract articles from their database.


## Project Overview

Specifially we'll look at:
