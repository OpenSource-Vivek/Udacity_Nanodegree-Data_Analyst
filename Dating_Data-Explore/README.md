# Data Explore - Dating Data

As a nerd, dating data is fascinating! In this exploration we'll be using [Town Charts](hhttp://www.towncharts.com/) populaton data to explore what area features relate to an areas single percentage.


## Dating Data Exploration

In this exploration, we'll explore what features of an area effect single ratios, and what that means for dating. Specifically we'll look at two hypothesis's in the dating community.

### Hypothesis 1

There is a widespread theory that the gender ratio of an area effects single percentage of that gender. This, from a theory, standpoint makes complete sense as human coupling (usually) is 1 to 1. Therefore if there is a gender imbalance of 54 guys for every 46 girls, there will be atleast 8 guys single. In this exploration we'll actually dig into the data and see how the ratio of women to men effect single percentage of that specific gender.

### Hypothesis 2

Another widespread theory is that age effects single percentage. For example, in areas with younger population, i.e. college towns there's a much higher percentage of single people, for a list of proposed reasons such as people are less serious about marriage, less serious about creating families, and for those in college life is potentially more of a transitory time with people enrolling and graduating. We'll be exploring this hypothesis, specifically how single percentage changes with age for different genders.
