# Project - Friend's Birthday's Analysis

In this project, we will explore my friends' birthdays using data downloaded from [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/). This is actual data from my Facebook friends.


## Project Overview

It feels that at least one of my friends is celebrating a birthday every day. So much so, it's hard to keep up with all the activities! In this analysis, I want to see which months are the busiest for friends birthdays, as well as what days in the month are the most likely to have friends birthdays.

We'll explore specifically:

* Friends who share my Birthday
* Friends Birthday by Day
* Friends Birthday by Month
* 365 Day View of my Friends' Birthdays.
