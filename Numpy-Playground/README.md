# Playground - Numpy

[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a library which provides functions that are especially useful when you have to work with large arrays and matrices of numeric data, like doing matrix matrix multiplications and dot products. 

Also, [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is battle tested and optimized, so that it runs fast, much faster than if you were working with Python lists directly.


## Project Overview

In this project, we'll play with the Numpy library, specifically:

* Arrays
* Arithmetic Operations
* Mathematical Operations


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Python (Minimum 3)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)


## Scripts

* `numpy_playground.py` - Script that shows off [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)'s various functions.
