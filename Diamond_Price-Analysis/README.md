# Price - Diamond Price

[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) provides a built in `diamonds` data set. We'll use this data set to explore a diamond's price versus its features.


## Project Overview

Ever wonder what affects diamond price? Ever wonder if you're getting a good deal on the diamond you're about to buy? In this project, we will use [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) to explore how a diamond's price is correlated with its features:

* Carat
* Cut
* Color
* Clarity
* Depth
* Table
* x, y, z (Volume)
