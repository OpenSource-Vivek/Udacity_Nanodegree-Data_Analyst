# Data Explore - Diamond Price

[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) provides a built in `diamonds` data set. We'll use this data set to explore a diamonds price versus it's features.


## Diamond Price Exploration

In this project, we will use [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) to explore how a diamonds price is correlated with it's features:

* Carat
* Cut
* Color
* Clarity
* Depth
* Table
* x, y, z (Volume)
